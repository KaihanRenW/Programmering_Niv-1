# Programming 1 – Moment 1: Assignment

## 📝 Assignment Title
**Build a Personal Info Program**

---

## 🎯 Goal
Use variables, input/output, data types, and simple math to create a program that collects and displays personal information.

---

## 📋 Instructions

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for the following information:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Year of birth
   - Height in centimeters
   - Country of residence

2. Calculates the user's:
   - Age (based on current year 2025)
   - Height in meters

3. Prints a summary like this:

```
===== Personal Information Summary =====
Name: Ren Westin
Age: 29 years old
Height: 1.75 meters
Country: Sweden
=======================================
```

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use `int()` to convert the year of birth to a number
- Use `float()` and division (`/`) to convert cm to meters
- Use string formatting or multiple `print()` calls to display the summary

---

## 🧪 Example Run

```
What is your first name? Sara
What is your last name? Nilsson
What year were you born? 2006
What is your height in cm? 165
What country do you live in? Sweden

===== Personal Information Summary =====
Name: Sara Nilsson
Age: 19 years old
Height: 1.65 meters
Country: Sweden
=======================================
```

---

## 🧩 Bonus Challenge (Optional)

- Add one more question (e.g., favorite color or hobby)
- Use `input()` to let the user customize the title of the summary section

---

## ✅ Submission
