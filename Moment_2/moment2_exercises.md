# Programming 1 – Moment 2: Practical Exercises

These exercises help you practice working with conditions, comparisons, and control flow using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 1: Even or odd

Ask the user for a number and print whether it is even or odd.

**Hint:** Use the modulo operator `%`.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 2: Age categories

Ask the user for their age and print:
- “Child” if under 13
- “Teenager” if between 13 and 17
- “Adult” if 18 or older

---

## 🧪 Exercise 3: Compare two numbers

Ask the user for two numbers and print which one is larger, or if they are equal.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 4: Grade checker

Ask the user for a score (0–100) and print a grade:
- A for 90–100
- B for 80–89
- C for 70–79
- D for 60–69
- F for anything below 60

---

## 🧪 Exercise 5: Password checker

Ask the user to enter a password. If the password is `"secret123"`, print “Access granted”. Otherwise, print “Access denied”.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 6: Logical operator test

Ask the user for their age and country. If they are 18 or older **and** live in Sweden, print “You can vote in Sweden.” Otherwise, print “You can’t vote in Sweden.”

---

## 🧩 Bonus Challenge

Ask the user what day of the week it is. Then:
- If it’s Monday to Friday, print “Time for school/work!”
- If it’s Saturday or Sunday, print “Enjoy your weekend!”

Use `lower()` to make your input case-insensitive:
```python
day = input("What day is it? ").lower()
```

## ✅ When you're done...

- Test your programs with different input values
- Make sure your conditions work as expected
- Ask your teacher if you need help
