# Programming 1 – Moment 3: Practical Exercises

These exercises help you practice writing loops with `while` and `for` in Python.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 1: Count to 10

Use a `while` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 2: Countdown

Ask the user for a number and use a `while` loop to count down to 0.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 3: Password check

Keep asking the user for a password until they enter `"python123"`. Then print “Correct password!”

---

## 🧪 Exercise 4: Multiplication table

Ask the user for a number and use a `for` loop to print the multiplication table (1–10) for that number.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 5: Sum of numbers

Use a `for` loop and `range()` to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 6: Print even numbers

Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 50.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 7: Ask until quit

Use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for input until they type `"quit"`.

---

## 🧩 Bonus Challenge: Number guessing game

Write a number guessing game using a `while` loop:
- Pick a number (e.g. 7)
- Ask the user to guess
- Give feedback: too low, too high, or correct
- Repeat until the guess is correct

---

## ✅ When you're done...

- Test your programs and change the input to make sure they behave as expected.
- Ask for help if you get stuck!
