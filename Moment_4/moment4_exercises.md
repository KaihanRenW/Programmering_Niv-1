## ðŸ§ª Exercise 1: Greeting function

Write a function called `greet()` that prints "Hello, world!" and then call it.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 2: Personalized greeting

Write a function called `greet_user(name)` that prints "Hello, [name]!"  
Ask the user for their name and call the function with the input.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 3: Add two numbers

Write a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.  
Ask the user for two numbers, call the function, and print the result.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 4: Check if even

Write a function `is_even(n)` that returns `True` if the number is even and `False` otherwise.  
Test it with several numbers.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 5: Temperature converter

Write a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
`F = C * 9/5 + 32`  
Ask the user for a Celsius value, convert it, and print the result.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 6: Maximum of three numbers

Write a function `max_of_three(a, b, c)` that returns the largest of three numbers.  
Test it with different inputs.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 7: Loop with function

Write a function `print_table(number)` that prints the multiplication table (1â€“10) for a given number.  
Ask the user for a number and call the function.

---

## ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge

Create a simple calculator using functions:
- `add(x, y)`
- `subtract(x, y)`
- `multiply(x, y)`
- `divide(x, y)`

Ask the user to choose an operation and enter two numbers, then call the correct function and display the result.
