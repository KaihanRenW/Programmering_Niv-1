# Programming 1 â€“ Moment 5: Practical Exercises

These exercises will help you practice creating and working with lists in Python.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 1: Create a list

Create a list called `colors` that contains at least 3 colors. Print the list.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 2: Access list items

Print the first and last item in your `colors` list using indexes.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 3: Update list item

Change the second color in your list to another color. Print the list again.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 4: Add and remove items

- Add a new color to the end of the list using `.append()`
- Remove the first item using `.remove()`
- Print the updated list

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 5: Loop through list

Use a `for` loop to print each item in the list with a custom message like:

```
Color: red
Color: blue
...
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 6: Build a list from user input

- Create an empty list
- Ask the user to enter 5 names
- Add each name to the list
- After the loop, print all names

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 7: Count items

Use `len()` to count how many items are in the list from the previous exercise. Print the total.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 8: Check if value exists

Ask the user to enter a name. Check if that name is in your list using `in`. Print an appropriate message.

---

## ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge: Sort and remove duplicates

- Create a list with some repeated values
- Remove duplicates using `set()`
- Sort the list and print it

---

## âœ… When you're done...

- Test your programs with different inputs
- Ask for help if something doesn't work
