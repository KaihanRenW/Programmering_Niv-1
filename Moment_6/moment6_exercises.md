# Programming 1 â€“ Moment 6: Practical Exercises

These exercises will help you practice reading from and writing to files in Python.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 1: Write to a file

Write a program that creates a file called `myfile.txt` and writes the line:
```
Hello from Python!
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 2: Append to a file

Modify your program to **append** a new line each time you run it:
```
This line was added later.
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 3: Read from a file

Write a program that opens and **reads** the file `myfile.txt` and prints its contents.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 4: Read line by line

Print each line from the file on a new line using a loop.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 5: Log names

- Ask the user for their name
- Save it to `log.txt`, one name per line

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 6: View log

Write a separate program that reads and prints all names saved in `log.txt`.

---

## ðŸ§ª Exercise 7: Count entries in file

Count how many lines (entries) are in `log.txt` and print the total.

---

## ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge: Word frequency counter

Write a program that:
- Opens a `.txt` file
- Reads the contents
- Splits the text into words
- Counts how many times each word appears

Hint: use a dictionary and `.split()`.

---

## âœ… When you're done...

- Show your teacher how your file programs work
- Check that files are being created and updated correctly
